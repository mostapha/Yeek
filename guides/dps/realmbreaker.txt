^ The idea  
Realmbreaker is a support DPS weapon. It has good damage but the most important thing is the max and current health it reduces from enemies. For that, you need to hit early before other DPS. So if the caller is counting down 5-4-3-2-1, you need to hit at 2 to reduce enemy health and help the other DPS hitting at 1 to kill.
