# Wailing Bow  
Great DPS weapon that is easy to play and offers huge damage based on how many people you hit.  
## Spells  
### Q2: Deadly Shot  
> Deals some damage and reduces damage resistance of all enemies hit. Keep using it to bully the enemy front line.  
### W4: Explosive Arrows  
> Enchants your bow and boosts your E spell damage. Always use it before your E spell.  
### E: Demon Arrow  
> Your main damage. When we are engaging and the caller is counting down 54321, use it on 1 with the other DPS. Make sure to use your W spell before it.  
## How to play it  
Position yourself away from the enemy zerg but close enough to engage when needed. When the caller is preparing to engage, find a good spot to hit from. When the caller starts counting down 54321, use your buffs (boots, jacket...) and use your W spell to enchant your bow, then hit the clump on 1.
