^ How to play it  
Position yourself away from the enemy zerg but close enough to engage when needed. When the caller is preparing to engage, find a good spot to hit from. When the caller starts counting down 5-4-3-2-1, use your buffs (boots, jacket...) and use your W spell to enchant your bow, then hit the clump on 1.
