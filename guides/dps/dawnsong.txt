# Dawnsong  
Dawnsong is a strong DPS weapon that offers anti-heal and damage over time. It requires a bit more skill compared to other DPS weapons since you have to aim your E spell.
## Spells  
### Burning Field (Q2)
> Keep using your Q spell on chokes, bridges, and to bully enemy tanks.  
### Wall of Flames (W2) or Fire Artillery (W5)
> ðŸ”¹Wall of Flames (W2)
> Use your W spell to keep enemies away from us after we engage or when we are kiting. 
> ðŸ”¹Fire Artillery (W5)
> Use your W spell to bully the enemy front line. It does a lot of damage and will not let enemy players step up.
### Flaming Phoenix (E)
> Use your E spell when the caller is counting down 5-4-3-2-1, hitting the enemy clump on 1.  
## How to play it  
Be in a good position away from the enemy caller. Stay in the backline and wait for your caller to prepare to engage. When the caller engages, use your buffs, hit the enemy clump on 1, and go back to safety. If you see the enemy zerg trying to counter-engage while you're still close, drop your W spell on them to keep them away.
