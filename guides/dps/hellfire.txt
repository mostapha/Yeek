^ Spells to use
## ✶ Dragon Leap : Q2
Mobility option. Use it to get closer to or away from the enemy zerg and to interrupt enemy players' spell casting.  
## ✶ Triple Kick : W1
Another mobility option. Use it to get closer to or away from the enemy zerg. You can also use it to kidnap enemy players or interrupt their spell casting.  
## ✶ Infernal Boulder : E  
When the caller is engaging, hit your E on 1. Since the spell has an animation, you might want to use it a bit earlier to make sure it hits on time.

^ How to play it  
Be in a good position, ready to engage. When the caller engages by counting down 5-4-3-2-1, find a good spot to hit from, use your buffs, and then use your E spell, making sure it reaches the enemy clump on 1.
