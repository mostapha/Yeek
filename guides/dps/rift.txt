# Rift Glaive
One of the best weapons for instant high DPS. It's easy to play, just maintain your Q stacks, and when the caller engages, hit the clump.

^ Spells to use
## ✶ Spirit Spear : Q2
Use your Q ability to get a **Spirit Spear charge**. The more charges you have, the more damage you get from your E spell. When you have 3 charges, you can slow down using the Q ability so you don't run out of mana too fast.  
## ✶ Deflecting Spin : W4
Use your W spell mostly to get your **mana** back. You can use it right after your E, or right after Q if you're low on mana. It also makes you take less damage and reflects all physical damage, so it's good to use if enemies start focusing you.
## ✶ Razor's Edge : E
Your main damage. Use it when the caller is engaging. Always have 3 Q charges before using your E to maximize damage.

^ How to play it
Stay in a safe position behind your frontline. Keep using your Q ability to always have 3 charges (and use W spell as needed to get mana back). When the caller counts down 5-4-3-2-1 step forward, activate your buffs, and hit the enemy clump on 1.
