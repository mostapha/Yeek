^ Spells to use
## ✶ Adapting Matter : Q3
Spam your Q to give people shields and to get shift charges.
## ✶ Polymorph : W4
Use your W on frontline enemy player or a mob to get bonus shift charge. You can use it on the enemy caller or any defensive tank who comes inside our zerg.  
## ✶ Sylvian Transformation : E
Use your E immediately after you get 3 shift charges, and stay in its form all the time, only switch back to human form to get charges using your Q or W spell. This is important to be able to cast your Sylvian Form W spell whenever we need it.
### Seedling's Bloom : Sylvian Q
It increases our max and current health by 10%. Use it only when you have more than 3 charges, so you can always cast Sylvian W when enemy engages.
### Barbed Roots : Sylvian W
You become immune to damage and give the team a shield and immunity to movement effects.
Can be used in these situations:
- Enemy caller is engaging or clumping us.
- Your caller is asking for defensives.
- Help us kite after engages.

### How to play it
Start by getting 3 Shift Charges using Q and W, then transform to Sylvian Form.
Stay always in Sylvian Form and only transform back to get more Shift Charges.
When the team needs urgent defenses, use your Sylvian W. Otherwise, use Sylvian Q only if you have more than 3 Shift Charges, so W is always available when needed.

Always be in your *Sylvian Form* and only switch back to human form to get extra **shift charges** as you need to keep 3 charges all the time to cast your Sylvian W spell.
Benefits of staying as Sylvian Form:
- Gives the team 8% more max health points.
- Can quickly use Sylvian W spell when defenses are needed.
