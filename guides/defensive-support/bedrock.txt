# Bedrock Mace  
Your job as a Bedrock Mace is to peel and help us kite, keeping us away from the enemy zerg. After we engage, use your E to stop enemies from reaching us. Use your E diagonally to block as much space as possible; don't just drop it in a straight line because they can easily pass through it. Make it hard for them to get through.

### What does it do?
It knocks enemies away, creating space between us and enemies, for example to reset cooldowns.
### How to use it?
You use it generally to protect us from enemies, either by stopping them or keeping them away from us when we are trying to kite.
- You can use it **after** we finish an engage, so we can stay away from enemies until we get our cooldowns back
- You can use it to push/knock enemy caller: you can use it directly on enemy caller to knock him back and delay him from engaging
- Try to use it diagonally to block big range, when you use it in choke try to block all the choke with it
