^ Spells to use
## ✶ Arcane Protection : Q2
Use it to give people shields; Shield your caller when he's trying to engage so he doesn't get popped.
## ✶ Motivating Cleanse : W2
{{motivating_cleanse}}
## ✶ The Void : E
Creates a bubble that grows up to 8m radius in 4s. It cleanses all debuffs (stuns, slows...) and gives damage resistance to allies inside it.  
You can use it in many cases:  
- When getting engaged on, as a defensive tool to cleanse anyone caught in the clump and give them resistance.
- When we are engaging, to help DPS reach the clump and not get stopped by enemies.
- When we are kiting after an engage and enemy tanks try to CC us, use your E to help us disengage.
- When passing the chokes: it's risky when the enemy zerg engages on us while we're clumped in a choke. Using your E in the choke helps everyone pass safely.
