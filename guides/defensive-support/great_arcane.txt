^ Great Arcane Tips
- Stop enemies when they try to engage on us. Try to catch as many DPS as possible.
- Don't stop the enemy caller only. Try to stop as many DPS as possible so they don't do damage, and to make the caller waste his E.
- Use your E to help us get our cooldowns back. After we do an engage, use your E on the enemy zerg to give us time to kite back and get cooldowns back.
- Don't use your E when we are engaging; If you use your E while we are engaging you are helping enemies by making them immune to damage, so only use your E when we are not engaging.
- You can use your E offensively to set up engages. When the caller asks you to use your E on the enemy (by saying something like "Give me GA front"), try to catch close enemies with your E so the caller can engage on them after the freeze ends.
