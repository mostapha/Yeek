# Rootbound  
Rootbound is a very important support. Your main role is to support the zerg with your E when the enemy is engaging or when we call for defenses.  
You should always stay in your *Sylvian Form* and only switch back to human form when you need to get charges. This makes sure you can use your Sylvian Form W quickly when the enemy is engaging.  
## Spells  
### Adapting Matter (Q3)  
> Spam your Q to give people shields and to get shift charges.  
### Polymorph (W5)  
> Use your W on front enemy players to get shift charges. You can use it on the enemy caller or any defensive tank who comes inside our zerg.  
### Sylvian Transformation (E)  
> Try to use your E whenever you have it. Only switch back to human form to get charges so you can react quickly when you need to use your Sylvian Form W spell.  
> **:small_blue_diamond: Sylvian Q: Seedling's Bloom**  
> Use it on people who need healing. It boosts the heals they get, but make sure you keep 3 charges to use it for your Sylvian W when needed.  
> **:small_blue_diamond: Sylvian W: Barbed Roots**  
> You become immune to damage and give the team a shield and immunity to movement effects. Use it when the enemy caller is trying to engage on us or when you see him clumping us. Also, use it when the caller is asking for defensives.
