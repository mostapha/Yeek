# Rootbound  
Rootbound is a very important support weapon in any zerg. Your main role is to support us defensively with your **Sylvian form W spell** when the enemy is engaging or when we call for defenses.

You should always stay in your *Sylvian Form* and only switch back to human form to get **shift charges** as you need to keep at least 3 charges all the time to cast your Sylvian W.

Staying all the time as Sylvian Form makes sure you always give us 10% more max health and can use your Sylvian W (Barbed Roots) quickly when the enemy is engaging or when we need defenses.
## Spells  
### Adapting Matter (Q3)  
> Spam your Q to give people shields and to get shift charges.
### Polymorph (W5)  
> Use your W on front enemy player or a mob to get bonus shift charge. You can use it on the enemy caller or any defensive tank who comes inside our zerg.  
### Sylvian Transformation (E)  
> Use your E immediately after you get 3 shift charges, and stay in its form all the time, only switch back to human form to get charges using your Q or W spell. This is important to be able to cast your Sylvian Form W spell whenever we need it.
