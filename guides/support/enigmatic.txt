# Enigmatic Staff  
A defensive support weapon that gives shields to allies within a 5m radius while channeling. It's used as a defensive tool when the enemy zerg is engaging on us.  
## Spells  
### Arcane Protection (Q2)  
> Use it to give people shields; Shield your caller when he's trying to engage so he doesn't get popped.
### Motivating Cleanse (W2)  
> Use it to cleanse people if they have crowd controls (stun, silence, roots...) on them; Cleanse the enemy engages (perma, stuns...); Don't use it for getting movement speed.
### Protective Beam (E)  
> Beam an ally player and give shields to all people around them. The shield absorbs damage and can last up to 8 seconds. Use it when the enemy is engaging on us—pick an ally in the area that's taking damage and beam them with your E.
