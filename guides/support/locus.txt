# Malevolent Locus  
A defensive support weapon that keeps cleansing all crowd controls inside a growing bubble and gives damage resistance while channeling the spell.
# Spells  
### Arcane Protection (Q2)  
> You use it to give people shields.
### Motivating Cleanse (W2)  
> You use it to cleanse people if they have crowd control effects (stun, silence, root...) on them.
### The Void (E)
> Creates a bubble that grows up to 8m radius in 4s. It cleanses all debuffs (stuns, slows...) and gives damage resistance to allies inside it.  
> You can use it in many cases:  
> :small_blue_diamond: When getting engaged on, as a defensive tool to cleanse everyone caught in the clump and give them resistance.  
> :small_blue_diamond: When we are engaging, to help DPS reach the clump and not get stopped by enemy tanks.  
> :small_blue_diamond: To cleanse chokes: it's risky when the enemy zerg engages on us while were clumped in a choke. Using your E in the choke helps everyone pass safely.
