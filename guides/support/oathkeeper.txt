# Oathkeeper
The Oathkeeper gives us increased movement speed and a shield that absorbs a large amount of damage for 5 seconds, it's important defensive tool that can help us both when we engage or we get engaged on.
## Spells
### Sacred Ground (Q3)
> You keep spamming your q ability in front of us so if enemy try to engage they get silenced and slowed, keep using Q on the ground whenever you can
### Guard Rune (W3)
> Very important spell. It gives us **damage resistance** and **immunity to forced movement effects and stuns**. Use it when we are crossing bridges and chokes so we don't get pulled and wiped in a bad place. Also use it when the enemy caller trying to engage on us so we don't get pulled and to get bonus damage resistance.
### Blessed Aurora (E)

> :small_blue_diamond:Defensivly you can use it after the engage while kiting or when the enemy is trying to engage on us, it's like your are using rootbound or enegmatic.
