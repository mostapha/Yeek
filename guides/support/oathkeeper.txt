# Oathkeeper
The Oathkeeper gives us increased movement speed and a shield that absorbs a large amount of damage for 5 seconds. It's an important defensive tool that can help us both when we engage and when we get engaged on.
## Spells
### Sacred Ground (Q3)
> Keep spamming your Q ability in front of us so if the enemy tries to engage, they get silenced and slowed. Keep using Q on the ground whenever you can.
### Guard Rune (W3)
> Very important spell. It gives us **damage resistance** and **immunity to forced movement effects and stuns**. Use it when we are crossing bridges and chokes so we don't get pulled and wiped in a bad place. Also use it when the enemy caller is trying to engage on us so we don't get pulled and to get bonus damage resistance.
### Blessed Aurora (E)
> Your main spell. You create a wall of energy that gives whoever passes through it increased movement speed and a defensive shield.
> **When to use it?**
> :small_blue_diamond:Offensively, you can use it when the caller is counting down 5-4-3-2-1 to protect allies from possible counter-engages.
> :small_blue_diamond:Defensively, you can use it after the engage while kiting or when the enemy is trying to engage on us. It's like you are using Rootbound or Enigmatic.
## Use cases
:small_orange_diamond:When the enemy caller is walking toward you, he transforms and tries to pull you! Drop a Guard Rune, then use your E.
:small_orange_diamond:When we are trying to engage, our caller is counting down 5-4-3-2-1, use your E to give our players some speed and defensive support while engaging
:small_orange_diamond:When the enemy caller pulls our team, drop a Guard Rune for them, then give them your E for a defensive shield
:small_orange_diamond:When we finish an engage and we didn't get a kill, the enemy will try to counter-engage. You need to give us your E to help us get back to safety
:small_orange_diamond:You can choose how to use your E spell depending on the situation. Just make sure it helps us at that time
