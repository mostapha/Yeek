^ Spells to use
## ✶ Frozen Surge : Q3 
Keep slowing enemies with your Q when other spells are on cooldown.  
## ✶ Frost Nova : W3
Use your W to get closer to us or escape from the enemy zerg. Since you'll be spamming your Q a lot, you might end up behind, so use your W to keep up with our zerg when kiting. This ability also has a stun, so try to use it when you're near enemy players.  
## ✶ Avalanche : E 
Use your E when enemies try to engage or when we are kiting. Your E knocks back enemy players and creates a slow area after the knock. This helps us disengage until cooldowns are back.
