^ Spells to use
## ✶ Iron Breaker : Q3
Spam your Q on enemies close to you. You can also use it when your caller is clumping enemies for an engage to reduce enemy damage resistance.  
## ✶ Inertia Ring : W5
Use the Inertia Ring to help us kite. After every engage we make, we need 15 to 20 seconds to get our cooldowns back. During that time, you need to slow enemies and keep them away from us. This spell helps you do that.  
## ✶ Earth Shatter : E
Use your E to stop enemy engages or stun enemies inside our team. We should never let enemy tanks inside our zerg because they will slow and stun us. Use your E on them to keep them out of our zerg. Also, if you are in a good position and see the enemy trying to engage on us, use your E to stop their backline so they don't do damage.
