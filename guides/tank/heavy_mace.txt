# Heavy Mace  
Your job as a Heavy Mace depends on whether you are an Offensive Heavy Mace or a Defensive Heavy Mace. If you are an Offensive Heavy Mace, your job is to catch enemies for your caller when he tries to engage. If you are playing a Defensive Heavy Mace, your job is to stop enemy engages. When you see the enemy zerg trying to engage on your zerg, you need to stop them.
## Spells  
### Sacred Ground (Q3)  
> Keep spamming your Q ability in front of us, so if the enemy tries to engage, they get silenced and slowed. Keep using Q on the ground whenever you can.  
### Snare Charge (W2)  
> Use your W to jump on enemies when they try to engage on us. You root them and then silence them with your E. You can also use your W to jump on enemies to interrupt their channeling spells, like Assassin Hood.  
### Battle Howl (E)  
> Silence enemies. Use it on the enemy zerg the moment they try to engage. Try to catch as many as possible and use it on them.  
## Smmary
### Offensive Heavy Mace
When your caller is trying to engage in a direction, you can set up the engage for him, so if you know he's going to engage east side for example, you can jump and root people in east side to make it easy for him to make a clump.
### Defensive Heavy Mace
Your job is to defend your zerg by stopping the enemy zerg from engaging. When you see enemy zerg is trying to engage, step up and stop them. Jump on them with your W and silence them with your E.  
You can tell when they are about to engage by watching when they use their buffs (boots, armor, and helmets).
