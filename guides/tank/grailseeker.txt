# Grailseeker  
Your main role as a Grailseeker is to help the team disengage and kite from the enemy zerg (play defensively), but you can also use your E to help with the engage by catching enemy players when the caller is looking to engage. Keep some defensive abilities available when you use your E offensively to help the team come back and kite.

^ Spells to use
## ✶ Cartwheel : Q3
Use your Q to annoy enemy tanks close to you, interrupt enemy spell casting, or stop enemy engages when they are looking to engage.  
## ✶ Separator : W4
Same as your Q, use your W to annoy enemy players close to you and to interrupt enemy spell casts and engages.  
## ✶ Soul Shaker : E
- When kiting, use your E to keep enemies away from our team. Make sure you use your E diagonally so it covers a long area.  
- When engaging, use your E to set up engages. When the caller is trying to engage, you can help by rooting the nearby targets to make it easier for him to clump them.
