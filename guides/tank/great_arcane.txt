# Great Arcane  
Your job as Great Arcane is to stop enemies and peel for us. Stay somewhere in front or sides, always watching the enemy zerg. When they try to engage on us, stop them with your E.  
## Spells  
### Arcane Protection (Q2)  
> You use it to give people shields.  
### Motivating Cleanse (W2)  
> You use it to cleanse people if they have crowd controls (stun, silence, roots...) on them.  
### Time Freeze (E)  
> You use it to freeze enemies, preventing them from moving or doing anything for 3 seconds. They also can't take damage during this time.  
## Tips  
:small_blue_diamond: Stop enemies when they try to engage on us. Try to catch as many DPS as possible. 
:small_orange_diamond: Don't stop the enemy caller only. Try to stop as many DPS as possible so they don't do damage, and the caller wastes his E.  
:small_orange_diamond: Don't use your E when we are trying to engage. If you use your E while were engaging, they become immune to damage, so only use your E when were not engaging.  
:small_blue_diamond: Use your E to help us get our cooldowns back. After we do an engage, you can use your E on the enemy zerg to give us time to kite back and regroup.  
:small_blue_diamond: Always use your W to cleanse us of debuffs and crowd control effects (roots, stuns, slows, and silences). The moment we get one of these effects, cleanse us with your W. The faster, the better.  
:small_blue_diamond:Use your Q to shield people who need healing. Always use your Q to give a shield to people who need it. If no one needs it, you can spam it on a tank or yourself.  
:small_blue_diamond:You can use your E offensively to set up engages. When the caller asks you to use your E on the enemy (by saying something like "Give me GA front"), try to catch close enemies with your E so the caller can engage on them after the freeze ends.
