# Damnation Staff
Damnation is a pierce weapon. Its main role is to reduce enemy damage resistance and make it easier for our DPS to kill them.  
When the caller is preparing to engage and counting down "5-4-3-2-1", you need to use your W spell, then your E spell in the direction the caller is engaging.  
## Spells
### Cursed Tar (Q3)
> Not very important, but keep using your Q spell in front to deal some damage to the enemy front line.  
### Armor Piercer (W1)
> Very important quick pierce (reduces enemy damage resistance). Use it when the caller is engaging. You can use it right before your E spell.
### Cataclysm (E)
> Creates a large pierce area that reduces damage resistance for all enemies inside. Use it when the caller is engaging. It's important to use it early because it has a long cast time, and you need to cast it before the DPS hit so they can benefit from the reduced damage resistance.  
## The idea
When the caller counts down "5-4-3-2-1", you need to use your W and E spells before he reaches 1 because all the DPS need to hit on 1, and your W and E spells must be used before that.  
For example, if you are using Scholar Robe, use it with your W spell at 4, then start casting your E spell so it finishes before the caller reaches 1 and the DPS hit.
