# Damnation Staff  
Damnation is a pierce weapon. Its main role is to reduce enemy damage resistance and make it easier for our DPS to kill them.  
When the caller is preparing to engage and counting down "5-4-3-2-1", you need to use your W spell, then your E spell in the direction the caller is engaging.  
## Spells  
### Cursed Tar (Q3)  
> Not very important, but just keep using your Q spell in front to deal some damage to the front line.  
### Armor Piercer (W1)  
> Very important quick pierce that you need to use when the caller is engaging. You can use it right before your E spell.  
### Cataclysm (E)  
> Creates a big area of pierce, reducing damage resistance for all enemies affected. You should use this when the caller is engaging. It's important to use it early because it has a long cast time, and you need to cast it before the DPS hit so they can benefit from the reduced damage resistance.  
## The idea  
When the caller counts down "5-4-3-2-1", you need to use your W and E before they reach 1 because all the DPS need to hit on 1, and your W and E must be used before they hit.  
For example, you can use your Scholar Robe (if youre using it) and W at 4, then use your E at 3 so it finishes casting before the DPS hit.
