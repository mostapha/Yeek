^ How to play it
### Offensive Occult
Use your Occult E when the caller is engaging by counting 5-4-3-2-1. In this case, you use it to help DPS and support reach the clump.  
### Defensive Occult:
Use your Occult after we finish an engage. You wait until your callers engages and all DPS hit then you use your Occult to help the team kite back or move to safe place.
### Occult on demand:
The caller will ask for Occult when needed, caller will tell what direction he needs occult at, something like "Occult east/south...". In this case, use the Occult E in that direction.
