# Carving Sword  
Your role as a Carving Sword user is to reduce enemy resistance with your E before each engage. This will help our DPS do more damage.

^ Spells to use
## ✶ Heroic Cleave : Q2
Use your Q to get heroic charges. You can use it on mobs or enemy tanks, but don't go inside the enemy zerg to use it because you might get targeted.  
## ✶ Iron Will : W5
Always use your W spell before your E when we are engaging on the enemy zerg. This spell gives you one more heroic charge, and more heroic charges mean more damage resistance reduction to enemies.  
## ✶ Fearless Strike : E 
Your E spell reduces enemy resistance, so it's important to use your E **before** other DPS hit the clump.

^ How to use it  
In Carving Sword, the more *heroic charges* you have, the more resistance you reduce for enemies. Make sure to get some charges by using your Q ability on enemy players close to you or mobs, then try to keep them up all the time. When the caller is preparing to engage and counting down 5-4-3-2-1, use your W first (to get one more charge), then use your E. You can use your E when the caller reaches 3 or 2 to make sure you reduce the resistance of enemies before the other DPS hit.
