Use your Q ability on enemy tanks and enemies close to you.

You can use your W after using your E when we are engaging on the enemy. It's a bonus DPS that can help kill.
### ✶ Corrupting Steel : E
When we are engaging on the enemy zerg and the caller is counting down 5-4-3-2-1, Use your E before DPS hit. A good time to use it is at 3 or 2 to reduce enemy damage resistance and helps DPS do more damage.

^ How to play it  
Stay in a good position away from the frontline and wait for the caller to countdown 5-4-3-2-1, then step up and drop your E on the enemy zerg, followed by your W. Just make sure you use your E before 1 so our DPS benefit from the resistance reduction.
