# Rotcaller  
Rotcaller is a support DPS weapon that prevents enemy players from getting healed for 2 seconds. Use your E when we are engaging and hit with our DPS so the enemy zerg finds it hard to recover from the damage.

^ Spells to use 
## ✶ Cursed Tar : Q3
Not very important, but just keep using your Q spell in front to deal some damage to the frontline.  
## ✶ Armor Piercer : W1
Very important quick pierce that you need to use when the caller is engaging. You can use it right before your E spell.  
## ✶ Plaguebringer  
Use your E when we are engaging on the enemy and the caller countdown reaches 2 or 1. It's important to use it when the DPS hit so the enemy zerg can't get healed.

^ How to play it  
When the caller counts down 5-4-3-2-1, find the clump that you are engaging on, and when the caller reaches 3 or 2 (depending on how fast you cast), use your W, then your E on the clump.
