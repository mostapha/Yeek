^ Spells to use
## ✶ Cursed Tar : Q3
Not very important, but keep using your Q spell on the enemy frontline to deal some damage.
## ✶ Armor Piercer : W1
Very important quick pierce that reduces enemy damage resistance. Use it when the caller is engaging. You can use it right after your E spell.
## ✶ Cataclysm : E
Creates a large pierce area that reduces damage resistance for all enemies inside. Use it when the caller is engaging. It is important to use it early because it has a long cast time, and you need to cast it before the DPS hit so they can benefit from the reduced damage resistance.

^ How to play it
The resistance reduction debuff from your E spell must be applied before our DPS hit.
When the caller starts the 5-4-3-2-1 countdown, use your Scholar Robe buff and start casting your E spell toward the engage direction. After casting E, follow up with your W spell in the same direction.
